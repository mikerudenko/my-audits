# initializeRenderer can be called by anyone and set malicious nft renderer

## Impact
The initializeManager function in the Vault721 contract lacks proper access controls. This means that any external actor can call this function and set a malicious address as the manager. This poses a significant security risk as the manager might have elevated permissions in the contract's logic, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or execute unauthorized actions.

## Proof of Concept
Next function does not have any access control restriction
```solidity
  /**
   * @dev initializes NFTRenderer contract
   */
  function initializeRenderer() external {
    if (address(nftRenderer) == address(0)) _setNftRenderer(msg.sender);
  }
```

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Implement proper access controls for the `initializeRenderer` function. Ensure that only the contract owner or a designated admin can call this function. This can be achieved using the `onlyGovernor` or a similar modifier.
